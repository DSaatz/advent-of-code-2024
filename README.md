# Advent of Code Solutions
Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This is where I document my journey through the coding challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual programming event filled with fun and creative puzzles.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a series of daily programming challenges released every December, designed to put your problem-solving and coding skills to the test. Each day features a new two-part puzzle, and participants can use any programming language to solve them.

## Languages used
Primarly **Python** will be used to supply solutions but eventually I will switch it up and use other languages I'm familiar with or new ones that I'd like to try out.
